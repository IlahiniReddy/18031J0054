Build a max heap with following elements(use the same insertion order) and answer the following questions 

100,  20, 3, 101, 54, 96, 103, 71, 60

1)Number of heapify operations  required to build a max heap.

Ans: 5

2)  Leaf elements after performing 2nd heapify operation(Right to left).

Ans: 103,96,54,60,71

3) Leaf elements after inserting all elements into max heap(First child to last child).

Ans: 20,60,54,96,3

4) Elements at level 1 after building a heap. (Left to right)

Ans: 100,20,3,101,54,96,103,71,60

5) Children of 101 after building a heap.(Left to right)

Ans: 71,54

6)  Elements at level 1 after sorting 3 elements. (Left to right)

Ans: 101,54,96,103,71,60


Activity-5:

Draw all of the different heaps that can be made from the five keys A B C D E,
then draw all of the different heaps that can be made from the five keys A A A B B.

Ans: The different heaps that can be drawn from A B C D E are as follows:

A B C D E
A B C E D
A C B E D
A C B D E
A B D C E
A B D E C
A B E C D
A B E D C
E D C B A
E C D A B
E C D B A
E D B A C
E D C A B
E D B C A
E D A C B
E D A B C

The different heaps that can be drawn from A A A B B are:

A A A B B
A A B B A
A A B A B


Activity-4:
Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but only a few remove the maximum operations. 
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, ordered array?

Ans:  Heap would be most effective
