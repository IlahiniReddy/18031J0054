Answer the following questions on Separate Chaining Hash table for the keys and its hash values.
Keys : S E A R C H E X A M P L E
Hash : 2 0 0 4 4 4 0 2 0 4 3 3 0
Note: If there are no keys write null, If there are multiple keys write keys with comma space separated

Ans: A A E E E

2.For the index 4, Write the keys in ascending order.

Ans: C H M R

3.For the index 1, Write the keys in ascending order.

Ans: No keys for index 1

4.For the index 2, Write the keys in ascending order.

Ans: S X

5.For the index 3, Write the keys in ascending order.

Ans: L P

Blanks-3:

1.In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys, the number of compares (equality tests) for search and insert is proportional to N/M. (true/false)

Ans: True

2.Any good hash function should have the three properties :  (true/false)

It should be deterministic, equal keys must produce the same hash value.

It should be efficient to compute.

It should uniformly distribute the keys.

Ans: False

3.How many empty lists do you expect to see when you insert keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 into a hash table with Separate Chaining Hashing with hashCode as key % size , 
for size = 2 without any resizing?

Ans: (1,0,1,0,1,0)There are no empty lists.

4.How many empty lists do you expect to see when you insert keys 2, 22, 32, 42, 52 into a hash table with Separate Chaining Hashing with hashCode as key % size ,
 for size = 10 without any resizing?

Ans: (2,2,2,2,2)9 empty lists.

5.How many empty lists do you expect to see when you insert keys 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 into a hash table with Separate Chaining Hashing with hashCode as key % size ,
 for size = 15 without any resizing?

Ans: (0,0,0,0,0)14 empty lists.

Insert the keys E A S Y Q U T I O N in that order into an initially empty table of M = 5 lists,
using separate chaining. Use the hash function 11 k % M to transform the kth letter of the alphabet into a table index.

Ans: 
 
  Address 0: E,Y,T,O
  Address 1: A,U,I
  Address 2: Q
  Address 3:
  Address 4: S,N
